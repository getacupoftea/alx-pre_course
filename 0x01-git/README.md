Tasks: 

0 - Step 1: says to create a github account
Step 2: says to create a personal access token : To create a personal access token, you can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) or you can just follow these simple steps:

When logged in to your github account, the next thing to do is:

Access Token Settings:

Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the GitHub interface.
From the dropdown menu, select "Settings."

Generate a New Token:

In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings." (scroll down to the bottom of the github interface)
Click on "Personal access tokens."

Now, you should see two types of tokens: the fine - grained and the classic tokens. As an ALX student, I do not think it was specified on which token we should create, however it is preferable to generate a classic token. 

Break: Let us tell the difference between the fine grained and classic tokens, just a brief explanation

Next is to set an expiration for the token. It is advisable to set it as "no expiration' cause this is mostly the token you will be using throughout your tasks as an ALX student, but you can also do as you wish. After that, the next thing to do is to select scopes, and they have already been specified in the project, all you have to do is go back and check.

If you check, you will see that you are to selct just three options and they are: repo, admin repo hook, and delete repo. It is important to do this step

Then, click on generate token.

Make sure to copy your generated token in a safe place, like your email drafts, notepad or sticky notes on your computer. The token will only be displayed once, so it is safer and advisable to do this
